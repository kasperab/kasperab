:wave: Hello! My name is Kasper and Iâ€™m a programmer. Specifically, I have a degree in game programming from [The Game Assembly](https://thegameassembly.com/). As part of my education, I also did an internship at [PortaPlay](https://portaplay.dk/en/), where I worked on the prototype for [Gerda: A Flame in Winter](https://dont-nod.com/en/games/gerda-a-flame-in-winter/). For [Presona](https://presona.se/), I did some work [modernizing their machine interface](https://kasperab.net/presona). I have experience with [several languages, engines, and frameworks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kasperab/details/skills/).
